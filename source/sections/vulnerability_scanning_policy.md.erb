## Vulnerability Scanning Policy

* Nessus management is performed by the <%= company_name %> Compliance Officer with assistance from the VP of Engineering.

	* All new vulnerabilities are verified manually to assure they are repeatable. Those not found to be repeatable are manually tested after the next vulnerability scan, regardless of if the specific vulnerability is discovered again.
	* Vulnerabilities that are repeatable manually are documented and reviewed by the Compliance Officer, and the VP of Engineering to see if they are part of the current risk assessment performed by <%= company_name %>.
		* Those that are a part of the current risk assessment are checked for mitigations.
		* Those that are not part of the current risk assessment trigger a new risk assessment, and this process is outlined in detail in the <%= company_name %> Risk Assessment Policy.
* All vulnerability scanning reports are retained for 6 years by <%= company_name %>.
