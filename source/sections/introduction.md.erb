# Introduction

<%= company_name %> is committed to ensuring the confidentiality, privacy, integrity, and availability of all electronic protected health information (ePHI) it receives, maintains, processes and/or transmits on behalf of its Customers. <%= company_name %> strives to maintain compliance, proactively address information security, mitigate risk for its Customers, and assure known breaches are completely and effectively communicated in a timely manner. The following documents address core policies used by <%= company_name %> to maintain compliance and assure the proper protections of infrastructure used to store, process, and transmit ePHI for <%= company_name %> Customers.

Below are mappings of HIPAA Rules to <%= company_name %> controls.

## <%= company_name %> Organizational Concepts

The physical infrastructure environment is hosted at Amazon Web Services (AWS). The network components and supporting network infrastructure is contained within AWS infrastructure and managed by AWS. <%= company_name %> does not have physical access into the network components. The <%= company_name %> environment consists of Apache web servers, Linux Ubuntu monitoring servers, and development servers running on Linux and Windows operating systems.

Within the <%= company_name %> AWS Platform, all data transmission is encrypted and all hard drives are encrypted so data at rest is also encrypted; this applies to all servers - those hosting web applications, databases, APIs, log servers, etc. <%= company_name %> assumes all data *may* contain ePHI, even though our Risk Assessment does not indicate this is the case, and provides appropriate protections based on that assumption.

There is data segmentation in place on the <%= company_name %> AWS Platform.

<%= company_name %> has implemented strict logical access controls so that only authorized personnel are given access to the internal management servers. The environment is configured so that data is transmitted to the application servers over an SSL encrypted session.

Once data is received from the application server, a series of Application Programming Interface (API) calls is made to the database servers where the ePHI resides. The ePHI is separated into MySQL databases through programming logic built, so that access to one database server will not present you with the full ePHI spectrum. 

The application servers are externally facing and accessible via the Internet. The database servers, where the ePHI resides, are located on the <%= company_name %> AWS Platform and can only be accessed directly over an SSH connection through the bastion host. The access to the internal database is restricted to a limited number of personnel and strictly controlled to only those personnel with a business justified reason. Remote access to the internal servers is not accessible except through the bastion host.

All operating systems are tested end-to-end for usability, security and impact prior to deployment to production.
